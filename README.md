# About The Project 

The current system, the farmers are using for the detection of diseases in the plants is that- they could be identified through the unaided eye and their knowledge about plant disease. For doing this, on a large number of plants is time-consuming, difficult and accuracy is not good. Consulting experts is of great cost. In such kinds of conditions to enhance the accuracy rate and make it more beneficial suggested techniques are implemented where devices are used for the automatic detection of the diseases that makes the process cheaper and easier. The high degree of complexity is incorporated by observing the symptoms on the plant leave optically where the plant disease could be easily identified.
